## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (Local Development)

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
- MongoDB Atlas Account (for cloud database) or local MongoDB instance
- Google Cloud Project with Gemini API enabled and API Key

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd sppu-student-portal
```

### 2. Backend Setup

- Navigate into the `sppu-student-portal/server` directory.
- Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:

  ```env
  PORT=5000
  MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String>
  JWT_SECRET=<A strong random secret key>
  JWT_LIFETIME=1d
  GEMINI_API_KEY=<Your Google Gemini API Key>
  CORS_ORIGIN_PRODUCTION=<Your Vercel Frontend URL, e.g., https://connect-ed-liard.vercel.app>
  CORS_ORIGIN_DEVELOPMENT=http://localhost:3000
  ```

- Install backend dependencies:

  ```bash
  cd server
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  ```

- Run the backend server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```

  The server should start on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### 3. Frontend Setup

- Navigate into the `sppu-student-portal/client` directory.
- Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory if needed (though `api/index.js` handles it dynamically).
- The `api/index.js` dynamically sets the base URL. For local development, it will use `http://localhost:5000`.

- Install frontend dependencies:

  ```bash
  cd client
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  ```

- Run the frontend development server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```

  The React app should open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
